## Security Best Practices

When using EtherFang in authorized testing environments:

- Use it only on authorized networks and systems you explicitly have permission to test
- Keep your credentials, API keys, and sensitive data secure
- Review generated reports for sensitive information before sharing or storing
- Update to the latest version regularly to ensure you have the latest security patches
- Run with the minimum necessary privileges required for your testing
- Maintain detailed logs and documentation of all testing activities
- Use EtherFang only in isolated, controlled lab environments during initial testing
- Follow all organization policies and security guidelines
- Never test on production systems without explicit written approval and proper change management procedures

## Controlled Environment Requirements

A proper controlled environment must include:

- **Network Isolation** - The test network must be isolated from production systems and external networks
- **Authorization Documentation** - Written authorization must be maintained on file
- **Monitoring and Logging** - All activities must be logged and monitored
- **Scope Definition** - Clear documentation of what systems and networks can be tested
- **Timeline** - A defined start and end date for testing activities
- **Recovery Plans** - Plans in place to restore systems if issues occur
